# KYU-CU-Website Upgrade

If you are reading this then I hope you know that the current Kirinyaga University CU Website was hosted but with very little functionality to the local user.
We have therefore embarked on a journey to make the website more useful by adding the necessary functionality so as to accomplish the set goals at the beginning of this project. We hope you will take this as a personal project  to make this project a succcess.

Below are some of the objectives we hope to accomplish by the end of this project:
1. Enabling searching of Articles written.
2. Making the website more responsive.
3. Decreasing the load-up time of the whole website.
4. Re-designing the whole website with the latest HTLM 5 rules.
5. Optimizing the offline functionality of the website.
6. Designing a new article page.

## Guidelines On Development 
This upgrade will involve a big percentage BACK-END DEV. So to make sure we are all on the same path we should have following in mind.
* We will use **PHP OPP AND PHP PDO** 
* We will use **PHP STATEMENTS** when doing any communicaton to the database. 
_**Note**_ that all of the above are for the **security** of our website

 
 I have also created a sub-domain [TEST.KYUCU.CO.KE](https://test.kyucu.co.ke/) for testing of the website during the development process and to reduce the deployment time  at the end of the project.
